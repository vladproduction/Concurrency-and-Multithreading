What is mutual exclusion Java?
A mutex (or mutual exclusion) is the simplest type of synchronizer â€“ it ensures that only one thread can
execute the critical section of a computer program at a time. To access a critical section, a thread acquires
the mutex, then accesses the critical section, and finally releases the mutex.
