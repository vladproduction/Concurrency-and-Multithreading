ThreadPool - the best way to organize many threads in scope of of one programme;
//ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

Marker that all events in threads done, count to down places we marked through code, after it come to '0' we can work with main thread;
//private static final CountDownLatch CDL = new CountDownLatch(8);
