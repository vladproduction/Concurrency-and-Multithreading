# Threads-and-Multithreads
**Repository representing theory and pactical approach for threads and multithreads in Java**
##
Multithreading in Java is an act of executing a complex process using virtual processing entities independent of each other. These entities are called threads. Threads in Java are virtual and share the same memory location of the process. As the threads are virtual, they exhibit a safer way of executing a process.  
In Java, threads are lightweight processes that enable concurrent execution of code, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously within a single program, while multithreading refers to the ability to create and manage multiple threads, improving resource utilization and application performance by enabling asynchronous operations and parallel processing.
