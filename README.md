# Threading-and-Multithreading

A comprehensive collection of Java threading and multithreading concepts, implementations, and real-world projects demonstrating concurrent programming principles.

## üìö Overview

This repository contains practical implementations of threading concepts in Java, from basic thread creation to advanced concurrent programming patterns. Each project is designed to demonstrate specific aspects of multithreading with clear examples and detailed explanations.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental threading concepts in Java
- Master thread synchronization mechanisms
- Explore concurrent collections and utilities
- Implement common multithreading patterns
- Build thread-safe applications
- Performance optimization with parallel processing

## üìñ Core Threading Concepts Covered

### Basic Threading
- Thread creation (extending Thread vs implementing Runnable)
- Thread lifecycle and states
- Thread priorities and daemon threads
- Thread interruption and graceful shutdown

### Synchronization Mechanisms
- `synchronized` keyword (methods and blocks)
- `volatile` variables
- Atomic variables (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`, etc.)
- Locks (`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`)

### Thread Communication
- `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`
- `CountDownLatch` for thread coordination
- `CyclicBarrier` for synchronization points
- `Semaphore` for resource access control

### Concurrent Utilities
- Executor framework and thread pools
- `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous programming
- Concurrent collections (`ConcurrentHashMap`, `BlockingQueue`)
- Fork-Join framework for parallel processing

### Design Patterns
- Producer-Consumer pattern
- Reader-Writer pattern
- Thread-safe Singleton
- Observer pattern with threading

## üõ† Prerequisites, Tools and Libraries Used

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)
- IDE with good threading debugging support (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
- Core Java Threading API
- java.util.concurrent package
- JUnit 5 for unit testing
- JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) for performance testing
- VisualVM for profiling examples
