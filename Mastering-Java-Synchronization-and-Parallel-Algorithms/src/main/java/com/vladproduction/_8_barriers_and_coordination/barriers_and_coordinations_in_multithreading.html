<h1>Barriers and Coordination in Multithreading</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Implementing Barriers for Thread Synchronization</h2>
    <p>A barrier is a synchronization primitive that allows multiple threads to wait for each other to reach a certain
        point in execution before proceeding. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a certain phase must be
        completed by all participating threads before moving on to the next phase.</p>
    <p>Java provides the <code>CyclicBarrier</code> class, which allows a set number of threads to wait at a barrier
        until all threads reach it. After all have arrived, they can all proceed.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Java Code Example: Using CyclicBarrier</h2>
    <pre><code>
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private final CyclicBarrier barrier;

    Task(CyclicBarrier barrier) {
        this.barrier = barrier;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is doing some work.");
            Thread.sleep((long) (Math.random() * 1000)); // Simulate work

            // Wait at the barrier
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has reached the barrier.");
            barrier.await(); // Wait for others to reach the barrier

            // Once all threads have reached the barrier, they proceed
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is proceeding after the barrier.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception in " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

public class CyclicBarrierDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int numberOfThreads = 3;
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfThreads, () -> {
            System.out.println("All parties have arrived at the barrier, let's proceed.");
        });

        // Create and start multiple threads
        for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfThreads; i++) {
            new Thread(new Task(barrier), "Thread " + i).start();
        }
    }
}
        </code></pre>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Explanation of the Code:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Class:</strong> This class implements <code>Runnable</code> and represents the work each thread
            will perform. In the <code>run()</code> method, each thread simulates some work by sleeping for a random
            time and then waits at the barrier using <code>barrier.await()</code>. After all threads reach the barrier,
            the barrier action is executed (printing a message).
        </li>
        <li><strong>CyclicBarrierDemo Class:</strong> In the main method, a <code>CyclicBarrier</code> is created for a
            specified number of threads (3 in this case). The second argument of the <code>CyclicBarrier</code>
            constructor is a <code>Runnable</code> that defines the action to be performed when all threads reach the
            barrier. Three threads are created and started, each of which will call the Task class's <code>run()</code>
            method.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Cyclic barriers are an effective way to synchronize threads when they need to wait for each other at a certain
        point in their execution. This can be essential in applications that require coordinated phases of processing
        and can help improve performance and resource management in multithreaded environments. By allowing threads to
        efficiently coordinate their actions, cyclic barriers can facilitate complex workflows and enhance the overall
        execution of concurrent tasks.</p>
