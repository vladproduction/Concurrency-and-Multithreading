<h1>Introduction to Concurrency</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Understanding Threads and Processes</h2>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> A process is an instance of a program in execution. It has its own memory space and system resources. When you run a program, the operating system creates a process for it.</p>
    <p><strong>Thread:</strong> A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within the same process, sharing the same resources but executing independently. Threads can improve application performance, especially in applications that require concurrent operations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Java Code Example: Demonstrating Threads</h2>
    <pre><code>
// Define a class that extends Thread
class SimpleThread extends Thread {
    private String threadName;

    SimpleThread(String name) {
        threadName = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(threadName + " - Count: " + i);
            try {
                // Sleep for a while to simulate work
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(threadName + " interrupted.");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(threadName + " has finished.");
    }
}

public class ThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create two threads
        SimpleThread thread1 = new SimpleThread("Thread 1");
        SimpleThread thread2 = new SimpleThread("Thread 2");

        // Start the threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        try {
            // Wait for threads to finish
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Main thread interrupted.");
        }

        System.out.println("All threads have finished execution.");
    }
}
        </code></pre>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Explanation of the Code:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SimpleThread Class:</strong> This class extends the Thread class. It has a constructor that takes a thread name as a parameter. The run() method contains the code that will be executed when the thread starts. In this example, it prints a count from 0 to 4 with a delay between prints.</li>
        <li><strong>ThreadDemo Class:</strong> This is the main class that creates and starts two threads (Thread 1 and Thread 2). The start() method is called on each thread, which invokes the run() method. The join() method is used to make the main thread wait for the completion of both threads before printing the final message.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Importance of Concurrency in Modern Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Asynchronous tasks enhance user experience by keeping applications responsive (e.g., UI threads).</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Utilization:</strong> Concurrency enables better utilization of CPU resources, particularly in multi-core systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Performing multiple operations concurrently can lead to significant performance improvements in applications such as servers and computational tasks.</li>
    </ul>
