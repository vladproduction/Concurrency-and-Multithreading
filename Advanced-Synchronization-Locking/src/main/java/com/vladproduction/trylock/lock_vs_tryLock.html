<h1>Synchronization Strategies for Shared Resources</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This document summarizes two approaches for synchronizing access to a shared resource (<code>itemsOnNotepad</code>) among multiple threads (Shopper instances) and explains why one approach is generally more efficient than the other.</p>

<h2>Case 1: Using Lock (<code>pencil.lock()</code>)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A Shopper locks the pencil when it wants to modify <code>itemsOnNotepad</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> If a Shopper has acquired the lock, others must wait until it is released.</li>
    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased waiting time due to only one thread being able to modify the resource at a time. Potential idleness of threads when waiting, leading to longer overall execution times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case 2: Using <code>tryLock()</code></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A Shopper attempts to acquire the lock using <code>pencil.tryLock()</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> If the lock is unavailable, the Shopper can proceed with alternative tasks (simulating buying other items).</li>
    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Enhanced concurrent execution since threads continue progressing without being blocked. Reduction in overall execution time through improved resource utilization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is Case 2 Faster?</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Non-blocking Behavior:</strong>
        <p>Threads that fail to acquire the lock can still execute other code, allowing continuous progress.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Resource Utilization:</strong>
        <p>Using <code>tryLock()</code> lets threads utilize CPU cycles more effectively, minimizing waiting times.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Parallel Execution:</strong>
        <p>Threads can switch to other tasks quickly, facilitating faster overall operation and achieving the target of processing up to 20 items more efficiently.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The use of <code>tryLock()</code> in Case 2 promotes faster completion times by allowing threads to perform productive work even when locks are unavailable, while the locking mechanism in Case 1 can create bottlenecks and result in increased execution time.</p>
