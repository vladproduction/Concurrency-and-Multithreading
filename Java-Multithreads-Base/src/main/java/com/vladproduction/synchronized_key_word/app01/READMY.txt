        In synchronization block:
    synchronized (this){

    };
    this - as monitor synchronization, before every using of monitor,
    run() check if monitor free to make next thread in according function.
    As long as monitor holds the execution function for current thread, no other thread
    is available to be at function that time!
    In that case each thread reached point of getting monitor, have to wait for it`s free.

    If we have several synchronized blocks, no available to have same object as monitor at same time!
