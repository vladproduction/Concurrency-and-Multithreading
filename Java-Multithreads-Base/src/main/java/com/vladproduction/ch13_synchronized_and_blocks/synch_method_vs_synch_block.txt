    (static synchronized methods):
Uses the Class object as the lock for both methods
Only one thread can execute either method at any time
Ensures thread safety but limits parallelism

    (synchronized blocks with separate locks):
Uses distinct lock objects for different resources
Allows concurrent execution of different methods
Maintains thread safety while improving performance
