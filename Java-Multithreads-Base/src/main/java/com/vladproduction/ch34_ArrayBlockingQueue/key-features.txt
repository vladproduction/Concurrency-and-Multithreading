Key Features of ArrayBlockingQueue
In both examples, the ArrayBlockingQueue provides these important characteristics:

Thread-safety: All operations are atomic and thread-safe
Blocking operations:

put() blocks when the queue is full
take() blocks when the queue is empty


Bounded capacity: Fixed size defined at creation time
FIFO ordering: First-in-first-out ordering of elements

In the first example, we see a basic producer-consumer pattern with a single thread of each type.

The second example extends this to multiple producers and consumers, each with their own thread,
demonstrating how ArrayBlockingQueue efficiently handles concurrent access from multiple sources
without requiring additional synchronization.
