Performance Optimization Techniques
To optimize thread pool performance:

Right-size your thread pool: Start with Number of CPU cores + 1 for CPU-bound tasks, and higher numbers for I/O-bound tasks.

javaint processors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
ExecutorService cpuBoundPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(processors + 1);
ExecutorService ioBoundPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(processors * 8);

Task granularity: Avoid very small tasks that could create more overhead than value.
Avoid blocking operations: Use CompletableFuture for async operations.

javaCompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    // Potentially blocking I/O operation
    return fetchDataFromNetwork();
}, executor);

Monitor and adjust: Use metrics to tune your thread pool parameters.
