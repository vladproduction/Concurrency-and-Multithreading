Code implementation:

    * Classes:
Car
CarRaceSimulation

    * Simplified Daemon Thread Configuration:
Added isSupport flag to indicate daemon status
Set daemon status directly in the constructor
Set meaningful thread names for debugging

    * Better Code Structure:
Created a more realistic simulation of a car race
Added comments to explain daemon thread behavior
Used the car race as a natural way to demonstrate daemon vs non-daemon threads

    * Added Educational Elements:
Used the metaphor of race cars vs. support vehicles to explain daemon threads
Added clear console output explaining what's happening during execution
Set up cars with various speeds to demonstrate thread completion timing

    * Enhanced Thread Management:
Added join() for non-daemon threads to show how the program waits for them
Explicitly avoided joining daemon threads to demonstrate how they get terminated

    * Demonstrates daemon threads in a simple but effective way:
Race cars (non-daemon threads) must complete for the race to end
Support vehicles (daemon threads) get terminated when all race cars finish, even if they haven't completed their routes

This creates a clear and intuitive illustration of how daemon threads work in Java.
