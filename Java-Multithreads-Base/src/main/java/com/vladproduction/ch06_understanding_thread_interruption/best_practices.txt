    === Best Practices for Thread Interruption in Java: ===

    * Check for interruption regularly:
In loop conditions: while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted())
Before starting potentially long operations
After completing operations that can't be interrupted

    * Handle InterruptedException properly:
Don't swallow interruptions (catching and doing nothing)
Restore the interrupt flag with Thread.currentThread().interrupt()
Propagate the exception or respond to it appropriately

    * Clean up resources:
Use finally blocks to ensure resources are released
Close connections, files, and other resources even when interrupted

    * Use cooperative cancellation:
Prefer volatile boolean flags for signaling shutdown
Use interruption as a stronger signal when needed
Never use Thread.stop() or other deprecated methods

    * For higher-level applications:
Use ExecutorService and related classes for better thread management
Leverage Future.cancel() for task cancellation
Use shutdown() and shutdownNow() for graceful termination
