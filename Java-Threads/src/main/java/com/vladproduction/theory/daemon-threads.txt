When to Use Daemon Threads:
Background Tasks: Use daemon threads for tasks that do not require user interaction and should not prevent the program from exiting.
Examples include background monitoring tasks or performing cleanup processes.
Resource Management: They're useful for tasks that manage resources during the runtime of an application without holding it open for completion.
Important Points:
Daemon threads have a lower priority compared to user threads; they do not prevent the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from exiting.
Ensure that daemon threads do not hold up critical resources, as they may terminate unexpectedly when the main thread finishes.
