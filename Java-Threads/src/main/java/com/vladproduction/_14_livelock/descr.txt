Explanation:

Persons: Two instances of Person represent individuals that are trying to pass each other.
Livelock Behavior: When one person attempts to pass, they check for the other person. If the other person is in the way, both will step back in response to each other.
Continuous Response: Because they keep stepping back in response to the other, neither person makes progress towards passing, creating a livelock.
Thread Sleeping: Both threads introduce a brief sleep to allow for mutual checking, reinforcing the livelock behavior rather than allowing them to proceed.

Key Takeaway:
In this example of livelock, both threads are active and constantly changing their state (stepping back)
but are unable to make any forward progress. Livelocks can be problematic as they often lead to excessive resource
consumption and overall application slowdown. Solutions often involve introducing conditions or timeouts to ensure that
threads can eventually complete their tasks instead of indefinitely responding to one another.
