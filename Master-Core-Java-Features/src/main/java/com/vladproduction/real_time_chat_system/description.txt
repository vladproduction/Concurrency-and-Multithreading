Here's how to set it up:

Step 1: Compile Java files
navigate to the directory containing your source files:
javac -d . com\vladproduction\ChatServer.java com\vladproduction\ClientHandler.java com\vladproduction\ChatClient.java

Step 2: Start the server,
Open a separate Command Prompt window and start the server:
java com.vladproduction.ChatServer
should see: "Chat Server started..."

Step 3: Start client 1,
Open another Command Prompt window and start the first client:
java com.vladproduction.ChatClient
should see: "Connected to chat server."

Step 4: Start client 2,
Open a third Command Prompt window and start the second client:
java com.vladproduction.ChatClient
should also see: "Connected to chat server."

Step 5: Chat between clients:
type messages in either client window, and they should be received by the other client.
When typing a message in one client terminal and press Enter, it should appear in the other client terminal prefixed with "Received: "

Tips for testing:
* all commands from the same root directory where compiled your classes
* the server must be started before any clients attempt to connect
* each component needs its own separate terminal window
* if you close the server, all clients will eventually disconnect

Common issues:
* the server should run first
* if clients can't see each other's messages, check the server console for errors
* if restart the server - need to restart all clients as well
